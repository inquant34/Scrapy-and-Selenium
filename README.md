# Scrapy-and-Selenium (Translation)
Scrapy and Selenium webscraper

Tried to automate Google's 'Translate to English' option with Selenium to translate a single Kompas news webpage before scraping. Unfortunately, while translation to English can be automated, it is unable to scrape the webpage in English or it works only partially. However, Web scraping with Scrapy as a standalone function works. May come back to revisit this issue in a later period.
